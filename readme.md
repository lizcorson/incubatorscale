HX711Addon: This is the working code exactly as uploaded to the Arduino at the submission of our project

HX711Addon_commented: I went back and added additional comments to document for future users. I wanted to include both versions in case I accidentally broke something while commenting.

InProgressProject: This was a more complicated version of the code that I wrote that didn't work out but future users are welcome to play with it.

libraries: This should contain all the libraries needed to run the code. Most of the libraries also have examples included so future users can learn how they work.

rtctest: This is used to set the time on the RTC board in case the battery dies/is removed.
